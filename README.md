# Berserk

**Berserk is a commandline tool written in python to increase website traffic**

**Berserk works with privoxy and tor and visits websites with different ips as well as different user-agents**

**Berserk only anonymizes the ``https`` traffic as privoxy can either be configured as a ``https`` or ``http`` proxy**

**so websites with ``http`` header will not gonna work**

## Usage:

***clone the repo ``cd`` in it and Just Type in**

``sudo chmod +x installer.sh``

**now type in**

``sudo ./installer.sh`` ***to install***

**type** ``berserk`` **For usage**
